My website for Election site.
The Site allows registrations for the both voters and candidates (a candidate need not create a voter account to vote).
Whether or not to allow registrations and voting is defined in model Preferences accessible through admin portal add can have only one object.
The site has one unfixed bug: vote does add to NumberOfVotes when a candidate votes for himself.
