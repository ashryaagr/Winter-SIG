# BITS ACM Winter SIG

### Step 1: Start with Python
Being proficient with the following is necessary:
You can refer

- https://realpython.com

for quick tutorials on
Lists 
Dictionaries 
String Handling
Classes and functions (important)
Importing external module
Using pip
Virtual Environments
Basics of Regular Expressions (for user validation and urls)
Basics of Decorator Functions (optional)
Write small scripts. You can do tasks in Learn Python the Hard Way 3.

### Step 2: Learn Django 

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/ ( Official Tutorial )
- https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/ ( Django girls)
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK ( New Boston )
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p (Corey Schafer)

### Advanced Stuff

- REST framework and json request
You can learn about Django REST framework from New Boston tutorials
or from Django documentation. To know how json requests work and what is REST API you can also refer to this link.
https://django-rest-framework-json-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

- Sessions and Cookies
           Best source for knowing what are sessions and cookies is “Tango with Django”.
         Other sources you can refer to are Django documentation and 
http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~leif/di/tutorial/cookie.html




### Tasks
Some ideas for projects are : 
- Make a web app for conducting elections.
- Chatting service ( MIght have to learn about socket programming for that )
- Prepare a backend for conducting quiz.
- Library Management backend.
- Aeroplane ticket booking.

You are free to build anything that you wanna make. We encourage you to think beyond these ideas and make something that appeals you. You need not make a good frontend for this. A minimal/basic frontend shall suffice

### Ideal Timeline

1 week for learning python
1 week for learning about web development and Django.
By the end of December, you should ideally have a good idea of Django
You can spend rest of your time making your project, which will demonstrate what you actually learnt.

### Submission

Submissions should be made by making a Pull Request to this Repository. You should make a separate folder with your name and put your code in it.

## NodeJS :

Instead of Python + Django, you can try learning javascript + NodeJS. You can use the ideas mentioned above and build them using nodejs.
